Placing ops events and controls into your chatroom (Slack, Hipchat, etc.)

???

Chatops is less about technology and more about communication. It brings your operations into a visible, auditable, collaborative location.

## Insight

What's happening in your infra, and why? Who did it?

## Education

Show users how to manager your infra by example, instead of with out-of-date docs

## Collaboration

Actionable notifications help everyone contribute to ops.

# What can your chatbot do?

- Inbound data
    - Query infrastructure state
    - Notify on app and infrastructure changes
    - Interact with tickets easily
- Outbound interaction
    - Deploy an application update
    - Scale up/down your infrastructure
    - Run build plans

# A thousand ways to slice and dice the task
